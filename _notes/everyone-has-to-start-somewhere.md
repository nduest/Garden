This is the first note I'm writing on this website. Quite fitting, as the subject is "everyone has to start somewhere".

When we look up to our role models, to Olympic athletes, to seemingly tireless overachievers, and to our more senior peers who seem to have it easier than we do, remember that they, too, had to start somewhere.

Related to starting points is the idea that it'll get easier as time goes by, but this is not always true: [cyclist Greg LeMond famously said "it never gets easier, you just go faster"](/notes/it-never-gets-easier-you-just-go-faster){: .internal-link}.
