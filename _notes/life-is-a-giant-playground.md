title: Life is a giant playground
---

As we become adults and specialize in a given domain, we gain knowledge that inherently becomes tied to our egos since it's a defining part of who we are.

For example, as a software developer, I am expected to know about basic computer science concepts, and if I trip up when explaining a given topic to a peer, it's a shame because I _should_ know it pretty well, but clearly don't. Doubt creeps in, and we start to think, "if I don't know this basic concept, then what do I know?".

As Anne-Laure Le Cunff highlights in a piece titled ["Stop looking for The One"](https://nesslabs.com/inverted-pyramid-life-2), we don't need to "define [ourselves] through a specific expertise". Instead we can decide to optimize for a wide array of opportunities and see life as a giant playground.

Learning entirely new things about which we have no previous knowledge is a great way to push the "specialization bias" aside. When we learn something new, we're not expected to know anything. What a freeing sensation!
