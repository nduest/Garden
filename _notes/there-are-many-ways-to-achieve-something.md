title: There are many ways to achieve something

We should not try to find the perfect solution: we'll only find ourselves wasting our time.

When I started programming, especially in university classes, I first had the mindset that there was only a single solution to a given problem, kind of like a mathematics problem where there is only one solution to `2 + 2`, and that it was my job to find that perfect solution.

Don't fret. [We just need to start somewhere](/notes/everyone-has-to-start-somewhere){: .internal-link}, and go from there. [Life is a giant playground](/notes/life-is-a-giant-playground){: .internal-link}: play around!

Otherwise, we fall in this "all-or-nothing" mindset, and it took me (too) many years to accept that this is almost never a good way to see the world.

Instead, and in programming especially, the situation is more like this: we sometimes know from the get-go that the answer has to be `4`, and we have the freedom to decide how to get there. We could go with `2 + 2`, or `3 + 1`, or even `2^16 / 8^5 * sqrt(4) + 8 - 4 * 2`. Of course, the [simplest solution is often the best one](/notes/the-simplest-solution-is-often-the-best-one){: .internal-link}.
