"There's no such thing as writer's block &mdash; only fear of bad writing, of what the world will say when it reads [your] bad writing." &mdash; Seth Godin

Fear is what prevents us from moving forward. And yet, we should consider that fear as a sign that we're about to do something bigger than ourselves, that we're potentially close to growth.

The best way to learn something new is to get that bad writing/drawing/paiting/singing/dancing out in the world (not necessarily in public, but out in the world in some way) to eventually improve.

In all cases, [everyone has to start somewhere](/notes/everyone-has-to-start-somewhere){: .internal-link}.
