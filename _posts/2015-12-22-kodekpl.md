excerpt: Seriously, who's that guy, and how is he committing to my repository?

<p>That's what I thought when I saw "KodekPL" as the author of a commit in my repo... A commit I had just pushed myself seconds before. But why KodekPL and not someone else? <em>Who is this guy?</em></p>

I'm willing to bet you play Minecraft. A lot of Minecraft. Enough to warrant the need of creating a server. Perhaps one day you downloaded Spigot. "Wait a second here, why are we talking about Minecraft? I'm talking about my GitHub repo here. Someone is in my repo! What the heck!?", I hear you say.

Turns out, there's a link between Spigot and KodekPL on GitHub.

Upon further investigation, <a href="https://api.github.com/users/KodekPL/events/public">KodekPL's GitHub email address</a> is "unconfigured@null.spigotmc.org". Git, for some reason, picked that up as your email address, hence the wrong author on GitHub. Setting the global variables fixes this.

{% highlight bash %}
git config --global user.email your@email.com
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
{% endhighlight %}

That's it. Push something to GitHub and enjoy!
