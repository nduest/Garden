<p>Just a few months ago, I arrived at my first apartment with my roommates. I was becoming an <em>adult</em>. It's only yesterday however that I realized something: Sherbrooke is now what I consider to be home.</p>

### Living in an appartment

When you move out of your parents' house, the first few weeks are slightly disorienting. There are *so many* new things to experience, it's a bit overwhelming! A new city and a new university to discover, new people to know, new systems to grasp, *et&nbsp;cetera*, *et&nbsp;cetera*!

For the first nights at my apartment, I had the same feeling we get when we sleep at a friend's or at the hotel: "Oh, it's temporary. I'll be in my real bed real soon". Except this time, you're already in your real bed at your real new place. It's a special feeling, but you just remember that one day, you'll feel at home here. And indeed, one day it hits you.

Sherbrooke is my home.

It hit me right in the face yesterday afternoon, at the end of my database class. It's my last class of the week, and when it ends at 1500, that's usually when I start to think about my weekend, whether I'm going back to my parents' or I have projects to work or chores to do or a grocery trip to plan.

But yesterday afternoon, I remembered I was staying in Sherbrooke for the weekend and it made me really happy. Not because I don't want to see my family. Not because I have to stay in Sherbrooke for a project. Just because I feel good here. Sherbrooke has become what I call home.

After a few weeks living in an apartment, you end up creating a daily routine (for your groceries, chores, studies, name it). In time, everything becomes easier.

### Mount Bellevue
If you didn't know already, I really, really like mount Bellevue. I'm lucky to live right next to it and every morning, I walk to university in Mount Bellevue Park. It might seem stupid, but half an hour of walking in the park is great way to wake up fast and feel good for the rest of the day!

In summer, deers show up from time to time, and in fall, the colors in the trees are truly beautiful. As for winter, I just don't know yet. I'll tell you about it in a few weeks.

In addition to being beautiful, the park is packed with installations for recreative activities. It houses a small alpine skiing station, walking trails, mountain bike trails, and I just learned that there are dozens of geocaches all around the park. All in all, as the official park flyer says, it's the best way to enjoy nature at the heart of the city of Sherbrooke!

There is however something I find disappointing. It's prohibited to ride a bicycle in the park between November and May. Meh. For winter biking lovers (that's me!), it's sad. Oh well, at least we can ride our bikes there during the summer I guess.

### Campus life

Université de Sherbrooke's main campus sits above the rest of the city (altitude wise). For starters, it's pretty epic to be on top on Sherbrooke to go study, but campus life itself is rad. Thursday happy hours are real fun, and so are the many initiatives of the faculties and University itself: I'm thinking about <a href="https://instagram.com/p/7dkSSUyGfW/?taken-by=viedecampus">Pedal your smoothie</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Viedecampus.USherbrooke/videos/vb.365392396990647/415718061958080/?type=2&theater">free hot-dogs under the Sun</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/p/7iuwrVSGYR/?taken-by=viedecampus">Vert & Or games</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/p/9gRTppSGeH/?taken-by=viedecampus">technical engineering projects</a>, <a href="//www.usherbrooke.ca/etudiants/concours-photo/">photo</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Viedecampus.USherbrooke/posts/433257093537510">literature</a> contests, and much more!

You can definitely feel how the University cares about its students, who in turn proudly represent their University. Whether it's a sticker on their planner or an internship around the world, USherbrooke students are proud.

Even within the University, there's a feeling of pride between the Faculties. Sure, inter-faculty rivalries are always fun and friendly. Maybe with the exception of science vs. engineering. But yeah. Maybe I'll write something about that in the future.

Living in Sherbrooke is like being part of a huge family. Welcome home. #sherbylove
